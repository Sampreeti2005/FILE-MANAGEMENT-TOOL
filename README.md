DESCRIPTION:

Task 1: File Management Tool
This task focuses on working with text files. The tool allows users to write new content, read existing content, and append additional information to a file. It uses basic file stream operations like ifstream, ofstream, and fstream. The task helps beginners understand how to store and retrieve data from external files, which is a common requirement in many real-world applications.

Task 2: File Compressor using RLE
This task introduces a basic data compression method called Run-Length Encoding (RLE). It compresses strings by shortening repeated characters (e.g., aaabb becomes a3b2) and can also decompress them back to the original form. It teaches string handling and the concept of reducing data size, which is useful in saving storage and optimizing data transfer.

Task 3: Multithreaded File Compression
This task builds on the RLE concept and adds multithreading to improve performance. The input data is divided into chunks, and each part is processed in parallel using multiple threads. It introduces the basics of multithreaded programming, which is widely used in real-time and high-performance applications.

Task 4: Expression Evaluator
This task teaches how to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions with correct operator precedence (e.g., 3 + 2 * (1 + 1)). It helps develop logical thinking and introduces core ideas used in compiler design.

Overall, the project offers hands-on experience in solving real problems using simple C++ logic and prepares students for future development work.
